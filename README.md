# Car brand classification using transfer learning
While building this project our objective was to predict the brand of the car [Audi(0), Lambhorgini(1), Mercedes(2)]  on different images based on the given image dataset. I have performed all the steps from data gathering to the model deployment. During Modelling step, I created Deep some neural networks from scratch (ANN) and tried to classify the images, then I also created some CNN's from scratch and checked its performance on the dataset too, what I found that both of these approaches didn't provide me satisfactory results (val_accuracy was around 50%), so finally using the concepts of transfer learning I used some well known models (Resnet50, VGG16 & VGG19) on the dataset and compared their performance on the basis of 'val_accuracy' metric and then find out the best one (which was Resnet50 giving the highest 'val_accuracy' around 70%), So in this module using transfer learning (Resnet50) & image preprocessing techniques I have predicted whether the given image belongs to audi, lambhorgini or mercedes.
